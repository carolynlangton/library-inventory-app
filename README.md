## Library inventory app

This application allows users to enter data associated with a library, including:
* books
* individual copies of books
* authors
* genres
* formats
* members

It also allows both administrators and members to log in using encrypted credentials. In addition to data entry, administrators can check out and return books for members. Members can check out books and view their transaction history.

It is a Windows desktop application built with C#, WPF and SQL Server. It was built in conjunction with two classmates as the final project of the Software Architecture class in the Software Developer associate's degree at [Northcentral Technical College](https://www.ntc.edu/programs-courses/all/associate-degrees/IT-software-developer).
